Myntra Clone Repository

This project is a working clone of Myntra, featuring a fully functional home page and add-to-cart functionality. The application includes a dynamic cart that updates as items are added or removed, along with a checkout page that displays the sum of all items in the cart.

Key Features:

Home Page: Browse products with a user-friendly interface.
Add to Cart: Seamlessly add items to the cart with a single click.
Dynamic Cart: View and manage items in your cart in real-time.
Checkout Page: Review your cart's total cost before completing the purchase.
This repository is a part of my full stack development learning journey, focused on building robust e-commerce functionalities.
